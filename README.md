# Visualizing Odd Values in Pascal's Triangle
- I wrote it to help out a friend with his curiosity to visualize the Pascal's triangle with only odd values being visible.
-  The `pascal_data.csv` was created using a spreadsheet inspired by [Making Mathematics 1999 - 2002.](https://www2.edc.org/makingmath/mathprojects/pascal/pascal_resources.asp)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `PIL` (Pillow) library

To install Pillow, run:
```bash
pip install pillow
```
